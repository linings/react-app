            <p>We’re so happy you’re interested in learning more about adopting with us!
            Our process has been updated to adjust to the challenges of the current
            state of our world in order to provide a safe environment for staff, animals,
            and potential adopters. We are currently processing applications remotely
            ahead of your first visit. We no longer take walk-in visits and cannot
            accommodate walk-in appointments at this time.</p>
